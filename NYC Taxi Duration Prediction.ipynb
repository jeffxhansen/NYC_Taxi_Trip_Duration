    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to tackle the challenge of predicting taxi ride durations in New York City based on starting and stopping coordinates. A 'taxi ride duration' refers to how long, in seconds, a taxi ride takes. This research question is relevant for urban commuters and transportation systems, and it incorporates the myriad of factors influencing taxi ride times. These factors include traffic patterns, congestion, time of day, and external variables such as local events or weather conditions. The strengths of machine learning methods align well with the intricacies of this problem, and allow us to uncover more nuanced relationships within the data. Beyond the potential convenience for individual riders, the ability to predict taxi ride times carries practical implications for optimizing taxi fleet management, city resource allocation, and enhancing overall traffic flow in New York. \n",
    "\n",
    "In preparation for our analysis, we conducted initial research about travel time prediction. We quickly learned about the importance of removing outlying data and unnecessary attributes [RR22] (see section `8. Data Cleaning`). Additionally, we learned which models typically perform best with travel time prediction [BLM18] and concluded that tree based ensembles are typically best for this type of task [HPMP20].\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle published the dataset we are exploring for a coding competition, so over one thousand other groups have investigated this research question. Successful teams performed feature engineering to create fields such as month, day, hour, day of the week, and used models such as Random Forest Regression, Extra Trees Regression, PCA, XGBoost, linear regression, and Light GBM [RIS17].\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset came fully complete, does not contain missing data, and includes fields such as: taxi driver, the number of passengers, and whether the trip time was recorded in real time. We added a second dataset that contains weather information with timestamps, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and wind information at every hour [AAD22]. The NYC taxi cab dataset was published by NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform and is well documented and densely populated with over one million data points [TLC23]. The weather dataset is much more sparse and has a much larger time range than needed to match the NYC Taxi data. These datasets provide a good source for addressing our research questions because they extensively cover NYC taxi travel for a significant time period. In short, the data allows us to effectively identify significant features impacting taxi trip duration and develop a robust predictive model for accurate estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we focus our primary investigation on determining taxi cab trip duration, we are also interested in several other questions. What days of the week and times of day are most busy? Where are the most popular destinations? Furthermore, the multifaceted exploration of temporal, spatial, and environmental influences on travel durations in NYC presents a well-rounded analysis to reveal comprehensive insights into travel behaviors. This poses questions such as how do environmental factors such as rain impact taxi popularity? Our data is well suited for our research question in exploring and predicting taxi trip duration, and has a single, clear answer. A process of machine learning model development will help us go one step further and develop a robust predictive model to estimate and understand trip durations accurately. Our approach, seen below, is comprehensive and unique in several ways, for example we use KMeans clustering to group the pickup and dropoff locations together, and use a grid search to find optimal hyperparameters of each model."

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxi cab duration dataset from Kaggle contained several outliers that required removal. For example, some trips lasted 1 second, and others lasted over 980 days. To prevent erroneous data, we removed all rows where `trip_duration` was in the $.005$ quantile, or less than 60 seconds. The dataset also contained outliers in the pickup and dropoff locations that fell far outside New York City. We fixed these rows by removing any point outside of city limits. For the full plot visualization, see section `8. Data Cleaning` in the Appendix."

    "## Datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important features in our dataset is passenger pickup time, originally represented as a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. We created multiple time features from this column including `pickup_month`, one-hot encoded `pickup_day` columns, `pickup_hour`, and `pickup_minute`. We also added other versions of these data points including one-hot encoded `pickup_period`, `pickup_hour_sin`, `pickup_hour_cos`, and `pickup_datetime_norm`. (see section `8. Data Cleaning.clean_data` in the Appendix)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pickup Period\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature `pickup_period` captures the time of day when passengers were picked up in one of four periods: morning (6:00 AM to 12:00 PM), afternoon (12:00 PM to 6:00 PM), evening (6:00 PM to 12:00 AM), and night (12:00 AM to 6:00 AM). These divisions align intuitively with significant periods of the day for taxi services, such as morning rush hours and evening nightlife. (see section `8. Data Cleaning.clean_data` in the Appendix.)"

    "\n",
    "### Manhattan Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "We include the Manhattan Distance feature because of its grid based metric. Many of the streets of New York are laid out in a grid-like fashion, so this metric can better approximate road distances than the Euclidean distance. The Manhattan distance is also more simple and interpretable, since it computes the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the two points. We calculated the Manhattan distance by first converting the pickup and dropoff coordinate points into radians and using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\text{Manhattan Distance} = R \\cdot \\left( \\left| \\text{pickup\\_latitude} - \\text{dropoff\\_latitude} \\right| + \\left| \\text{pickup\\_longitude} - \\text{dropoff\\_longitude} \\right| \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- <h3>2.1.1 Computing Distance with Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "With over 1.4 million data points over a relatively small geography, the pick up and dropoff locations provide an effective proxy for the actual road map of New York. We can use this information to estimate the distance between the two points using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. We chose to use Dijkstra's algorithm because it is a well known and well documented algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. We modified the algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph, where the edges of the graph are the roads in New York City with weights equal to their geographic length, and the nodes are the pick up and dropoff locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the size of the graph by removing nodes that are too close together, removing the few hundred nodes that lie well outside the metropolitan area, and cropping the graph for each distance calculation to only include nodes that lie roughly between the pick up and dropoff locations. This reduces the size of the graph from over 1.4 million nodes to a few thousand nodes. We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the pick up and dropoff locations. The resulting cost of the shortest path is an estimate of the actual driving distance required to travel between the two points, which is one of the strongest predictors of taxi ride duration. -->"

    "### KMeans Clustering Average Duration\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with incorporating distance metrics and weather information, we also added a duration feature that acts as an initial estimate for the model's actual trip duration prediction. To do this, we fit a pickup and dropoff KMeans clustering model with 200 clusters as shown in section `4. Data Visualization`. We then labeled each pickup location and dropoff location in the data with its respective cluster label. By grouping the data by these cluster pairs, we computed the average trip_duration between each cluster pair and merged this onto the original dataframe. See section `6. KMeans Clustering` in the Appendix for the full code implementation. This feature helps by giving the model a baseline for what duration to expect based on location. It also allows us to segment the data in a way that can group outliers, or large distance locations, together and improve accuracy by grouping like locations together. (see section `9. Feature Engineering.add_avg_cluster_duration` in the Appendix.)"

For example, if it is raining or snowing, we may assume there will be more traffic on the roads, and more people who would normally walk would prefer a taxi. A dataset created by Kaggle user [AAD22] contains a myriad of weather data for New York City between 2016 and 2022 on an hourly basis. This dataset includes features such as temperature (in Celcius), precipition (in mm), cloud cover (low, mid, high, and total), wind speed (in km/h), and wind direction. We decided to use temperature, precipitation, and total cloud cover as features in our dataset with a simple join on the pickup datetime rounded to the nearest whole hour. (see sections `8. Data Cleaning.get_clean_weather` and `9. Feature Engineering.add_weather_feature` in the Appendix.)"

    "\n",
    "To determine the most important features, we utilized $L^1$ regularization since it functions by setting unneeded feature coefficents to 0 and typically out-performs step-wise feature removal. We did not use $L^2$ regularization because the large number of features allows $L^1$ regularization to perform better."

    "The figures below depict the actual distribution of taxi trip durations along with our model's predicted distributions (see section `7. Visualizations.plot_actual_vs_predicted_distributions` in the Appendix). The plot on the left depicts the distribution of outputs from a LightGBM model with optimal parameters (100 `estimators`, 30 `leaves`, and a `max_depth` of 50). This model is not very strong, as it predicts the mean of the actual distribution almost exclusively. This poor performance implies that the feature space is not large enough for the model to create a more accurate approximation of the distribution. \n",

    "We generated the plot on the right with a different LightGBM model using much larger parameters (100,000 `estimators`, 500 `leaves` and a `max_depth` of 50). This model took a full hour to train and around 15 minutes to make predictions. As the prediction distribution demonstrates, this model makes predictions farther from the mean, indicating that the model fits the data better as we raise its complexity and compute capabilities. With enough compute resources and time, we could increase the model parameters to higher values and create more features for the data. This upgrade would allow the model to better approximate the data instead of simply predicting the mean."

    "The maps below plots cluster pairs which have the highest travel time to distance traveled ratio on average (see section `7. Visualizations.duration_per_distance` in the Appendix). Interestingly, some of the cluster paths cross major roadways, implying that there should be more support roads that cross under or over the major highways. Furthermore, a majority of the largest duration trips per distance occur in Manhattan. This demonstrates that the public transit system could be improved to optimize taxi traffic use."

    "# Ethical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research involves analyzing a large dataset created by tracking some of the life-style patterns of real people living in New York during 2016, raising concerns about privacy and responsible data usage for individual behaviors, locations, and travel patterns. Our dataset and model protect this data by excluding all personally identifiable information to ensure that only aggregate information can be meaningful, and the patterns of individuals remain indiscernible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of misinterpretation or misuse of our predictive models is very real—especially considering its weak predictive power. Users could misunderstand predictions, leading to inappropriate decision-making. Our predictive model may contain and inadvertently perpetuate biases that we are unaware of, such as inappropriate associations with certain neighborhoods and taxis. Furthermore, users might misunderstand the predictive and uncertain nature of the model and treat its estimates as certainties. For instance, if taxi companies or transportation authorities were to make decisions solely based on the model's predictions without considering broader traffic management strategies, it could inadvertently lead to concentrated traffic, worsening congestion in certain areas. If our model were deployed in conjunction with algorithms influencing taxi availability, the system might inadvertently create self-fulfilling feedback loops, disproportionately affecting certain areas or demographics that cannot afford taxi's and therefore will not be seen in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, clear communication about the model's limitations, potential biases, and intended use is crucial. Providing educational resources, user-friendly interfaces, adequate documentation, and implementing fairness-aware algorithms can contribute to responsible and ethical deployment. Regular assessments, periodic audits, and interventions are necessary to avoid reinforcing existing biases. We have also considered ethical responsibilities such as the responsible disclosure of findings, ensuring the public benefits from the research, and avoiding any unintentional harm. Active engagement with potential stakeholders and the community can further help address concerns and foster ethical practices.\n"
