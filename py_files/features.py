def distance(df):
    """
    Calculate the Manhattan distance in kilometers between pickup and dropoff locations
    and add it as a new column 'distance_km' to the DataFrame.

    The Manhattan distance, also known as the L1 distance or taxicab distance, between two points
    on the Earth's surface is calculated by finding the absolute differences between their respective
    longitudes and latitudes and summing them up. This function computes the Manhattan distance
    in kilometers between the pickup and dropoff locations in a DataFrame, assuming a constant
    Earth radius of 6371 kilometers.

    Parameters:
    df (pandas.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing pickup and dropoff coordinates with columns
                           'pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude', 'dropoff_longitude', and 'dropoff_latitude'.

    Returns:
    pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame with an additional 'distance_km' column representing the Manhattan
                     distance in kilometers between pickup and dropoff locations.
