    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to tackle the challenge of predicting taxi ride durations in New York City based on starting and stopping coordinates. This research question is very relevant for urban commuters and transportation systems and incorporates the myriad factors influencing taxi ride times, including traffic patterns, congestion, time of day, and external variables such as events or weather conditions. The strengths of machine learning methods align well with the intricacies of this problem, and allow us to uncover more nuanced relationships within the data. Beyond individual convenience, the ability to predict taxi ride times carries practical implications for optimizing taxi fleet management, resource allocation, and enhancing overall traffic flow in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle published the dataset we are working on for a coding competition, so over one thousand other groups have investigated this research question. Successful teams performed feature engineering to create fields such as month, day, hour, day of the week, and used models such as Random Forest Regression, Extra Trees Regression, PCA, XGBoost, linear regression, and Light GBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset also includes fields for the taxi driver, the number of passengers, and whether the trip time was recorded in real time. The second dataset contains weather information with timestamps, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and wind information at every hour. The NYC taxi cab dataset was published by NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform and is well documented and densely populated with over one million data points. The weather dataset is much more sparse and has a much larger time range than needed to match the NYC Taxi data. These datasets provide a good source for addressing our research questions because they extensively cover NYC taxi travel for a significant time period. In short, the data allows us to effectively identify significant features impacting taxi trip duration and develop a robust predictive model for accurate estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our primary investigation is focused on determining taxi cab trip duration, we are also interested in several other questions. What dates, days of the week, and times of day are most busy? Where are the most popular destinations? Furthermore, the multifaceted exploration of temporal, spatial, and environmental influences on travel durations in NYC presents a well-rounded analysis to reveal comprehensive insights into travel behaviors. This poses questions such as how do environmental factors such as rain impact taxi popularity? Which pickup and drop off locations have the highest average time by distance? Our data is well suited for our research question in exploring and predicting taxi trip duration, and has a single, clear answer. A process of machine learning model development will help us go one step further and develop a robust predictive model to estimate and understand trip durations accurately."

    "In our pursuit to enhance the predictive power of our model, we identified the necessity for additional features in our dataset. This realization led to the development of three distinct feature groups: datetime, distance, and weather. \n",

    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxi cab duraction dataset from Kaggle contained several outlier data that required to removal. For example, some trips lasted 1 second, and others lasted over 980 days. To prevent erroneous data, we removed all rows where <code>trip_duration</code> was in the $.005$ quantile or less than 60 seconds. The dataset also contained outliers in the pick up and drop off locations that were far outside New York City, which we fixed by removed any point outside of city limits."

    "## Datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important features in our dataset is passenger pickup time, originally represented in a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. We created multiple time features from this column including `pickup_month`, one-hot encoded `pickup_day`, `pickup_hour`, and `pickup_minute`. We also added other versions of these data points including one-hot encoded `pickup_period`, `pickup_hour_sin`, `pickup_hour_cos`, and `pickup_datetime_norm`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pickup Period\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature `pickup_period` captures the time of day when passengers were picked up in one of four periods: morning (6:00 AM to 12:00 PM), afternoon (12:00 PM to 6:00 PM), evening (6:00 PM to 12:00 AM), and night (12:00 AM to 6:00 AM). These divisions align intuitively with significant periods of the day for taxi services, such as morning rush hours and evening nightlife.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Manhattan Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "We include the Manhattan Distance feature because of its grid based metric. Many of the streets of New York are laid out in a grid-like fashion, so this metric can better approximate road distances than the Euclidean distance. The Manhattan distance is also more simple and interpretable, since it computes the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the two points. We calculated the Manhattan distance by first converting the pickup and dropoff coordinate points into radians and using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\text{Manhattan Distance} = R \\cdot \\left( \\left| \\text{pickup\\_latitude} - \\text{dropoff\\_latitude} \\right| + \\left| \\text{pickup\\_longitude} - \\text{dropoff\\_longitude} \\right| \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- <h3>2.1.1 Computing Distance with Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "With over 1.4 million data points over a relatively small geography, the pick up and drop off locations provide an effective proxy for the actual road map of New York. We can use this information to estimate the distance between the two points using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. We chose to use Dijkstra's algorithm because it is a well known and well documented algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. We modified the algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph, where the edges of the graph are the roads in New York City with weights equal to their geographic length, and the nodes are the pick up and drop off locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the size of the graph by removing nodes that are too close together, removing the few hundred nodes that lie well outside the metropolitan area, and cropping the graph for each distance calculation to only include nodes that lie roughly between the pick up and drop off locations. This reduces the size of the graph from over 1.4 million nodes to a few thousand nodes. We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the pick up and drop off locations. The resulting cost of the shortest path is an estimate of the actual driving distance required to travel between the two points, which is one of the strongest predictors of taxi ride duration. -->"

    "### KMeans Clustering Average Duration\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with incorporating distance metrics and weather information, we also added a duration feature that acts as an initial estimate for the model's actual trip duration prediction. To do this, we fit a pickup and dropoff KMeans clustering model with 200 clusters. Images of these are shown in section `4. Data Visualization`. We then labeled each pickup location and drop off location in the data with its respective cluster label. By grouping the data by these cluster pairs, we computed the average trip_duration between each cluster pair and merged this onto the original dataframe. See Appendix for the full code implementation."

A dataset created by Kaggle user [@Aadam](https://www.kaggle.com/aadimator) contains a miriad of weather data for New York City between 2016 and 2022 on an hourly basis. This dataset includes features such as temperature (in Celcius), precipition (in mm), cloud cover (low, mid, high, and total), wind speed (in km/h), and wind direction. We decided to use temperature, precipitation, and total cloud cover as features in our dataset with a simple join on the pickup datetime, rounded to the nearest whole hour."

    "# Ethical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Our research delves into a comprehensive dataset meticulously crafted by tracking the lifestyle patterns of real individuals residing in New York throughout 2016. This exploration raises paramount concerns surrounding privacy and the responsible usage of data pertaining to individual behaviors, locations, and travel patterns. To safeguard the integrity of this data, our dataset and model meticulously exclude all personally identifiable information, ensuring that only aggregate information is extracted. This approach guarantees that the distinctive patterns of individuals remain indiscernible, prioritizing privacy and ethical data handling.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>However, the potential risks associated with the misinterpretation or misuse of our predictive models cannot be understated. Users may misconstrue predictions, leading to inappropriate decision-making. Unintentional biases within our predictive model may persist, potentially reinforcing inappropriate associations with specific neighborhoods and taxi services. Additionally, users may overlook the inherent uncertainties and predictive nature of the model, treating its estimates as certainties.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Such misinterpretations could have tangible consequences. For example, if taxi companies or transportation authorities solely rely on the model's predictions without considering broader traffic management strategies, it may inadvertently exacerbate congestion in certain areas. Deploying our model in conjunction with algorithms influencing taxi availability could create self-fulfilling feedback loops, disproportionately impacting specific areas or demographics.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>To mitigate these challenges, transparent communication about the model's limitations, potential biases, and intended use is paramount. We emphasize the importance of providing:</p>\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Educational resources</li>\n",
    "  <li>User-friendly interfaces</li>\n",

    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Implementing fairness-aware algorithms is essential to ensure ethical deployment. Regular assessments, periodic audits, and proactive interventions are crucial to prevent the reinforcement of existing biases.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Furthermore, we recognize our ethical responsibilities, including the responsible disclosure of findings, ensuring public benefit from the research, and avoiding unintentional harm. Actively engaging with potential stakeholders and the community fosters ethical practices, addressing concerns and promoting responsible data science. Our commitment extends to ongoing efforts to uphold the highest standards of privacy, responsibility, and transparency in our research endeavors.</p>\n"
