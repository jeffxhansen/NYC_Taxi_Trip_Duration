    "We aim to tackle the challenge of predicting taxi ride durations in New York City based on starting and stopping coordinates. This research question is very relevant for urban commuters and transportation systems and incorporates the myriad factors influencing taxi ride times, including traffic patterns, congestion, time of day, and external variables such as events or weather conditions. The strengths of machine learning methods align well with the intricacies of this problem, and allow us to uncover more nuanced relationships within the data. Beyond individual convenience, the ability to predict taxi ride times carries practical implications for optimizing taxi fleet management, resource allocation, and enhancing overall traffic flow in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle published the dataset we are working on for a coding competition, so over one thousand other groups have investigated this research question. Successful teams performed feature engineering to create fields such as month, day, hour, day of the week, and used models such as Random Forest Regression, Extra Trees Regression, PCA, XGBoost, linear regression, and Light GBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset also includes fields for the taxi driver, the number of passengers, and whether the trip time was recorded in real time. The second dataset contains weather information with timestamps, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and wind information at every hour. The NYC taxi cab dataset was published by NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform and is well documented and densely populated with over one million data points. The weather dataset is much more sparse and has a much larger time range than needed to match the NYC Taxi data. These datasets provide a good source for addressing our research questions because they extensively cover NYC taxi travel for a significant time period. In short, the data allows us to effectively identify significant features impacting taxi trip duration and develop a robust predictive model for accurate estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our primary investigation is focused on determining taxi cab trip duration, we are also interested in several other questions. What dates, days of the week, and times of day are most busy? Where are the most popular destinations? What factors influence taxi trip time the most? Furthermore, the multifaceted exploration of temporal, spatial, and environmental influences on travel durations in NYC presents a well-rounded analysis to reveal comprehensive insights into travel behaviors. Our data is well suited for our research question in exploring and predicting taxi trip duration, and has a single, clear answer. A process of machine learning model development will help us go one step further and develop a robust predictive model to estimate and understand trip durations accurately."

To prevent erroneous data, we removed all rows where <code>trip_duration</code> was in the $.005$ quantile or less than 60 seconds. The dataset also contained outliers in the pick up and drop off locations that were far outside New York City, which we fixed by removed any point outside of city limits."

    "We include the Manhattan Distance feature because of its grid based metric. Many of the streets of New York are laid out in a grid-like fashion, so this metric can better approximate road distances than the Euclidean distance. The Manhattan distance is also more simple and interpretable, since it computes the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the two points. We calculated the Manhattan distance by first converting the pickup and dropoff coordinate points into radians and using the following formula:\n",

    "With over 1.4 million data points over a relatively small geography, the pick up and drop off locations provide an effective proxy for the actual road map of New York. We can use this information to estimate the distance between the two points using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. We chose to use Dijkstra's algorithm because it is a well known and well documented algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. We modified the algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph, where the edges of the graph are the roads in New York City with weights equal to their geographic length, and the nodes are the pick up and drop off locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the size of the graph by removing nodes that are too close together, removing the few hundred nodes that lie well outside the metropolitan area, and cropping the graph for each distance calculation to only include nodes that lie roughly between the pick up and drop off locations. This reduces the size of the graph from over 1.4 million nodes to a few thousand nodes. We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the pick up and drop off locations. The resulting cost of the shortest path is an estimate of the actual driving distance required to travel between the two points, which is one of the strongest predictors of taxi ride duration. -->"

To do this, we fit a pickup and dropoff KMeans clustering model with 200 clusters. Images of these are shown in section `4. Data Visualization`. We then labeled each pickup location and drop off location in the data with its respective cluster label. By grouping the data by these cluster pairs, we computed the average trip_duration between each cluster pair and merged this onto the original dataframe.

A dataset created by Kaggle user [@Aadam](https://www.kaggle.com/aadimator) contains a miriad of weather data for New York City between 2016 and 2022 on an hourly basis. This dataset includes features such as temperature (in Celcius), precipition (in mm), cloud cover (low, mid, high, and total), wind speed (in km/h), and wind direction. We decided to use temperature, precipitation, and total cloud cover as features in our dataset with a simple join on the pickup datetime, rounded to the nearest whole hour."

    "Our research involves analyzing a large dataset created by tracking some of the life-style patterns of real people living in New York during 2016, raising concerns about privacy and responsible data usage for individual behaviors, locations, and travel patterns. Our dataset and model protect this data by excluding all personally identifiable information to ensure that only aggregate information can be meaningful, and the patterns of individuals remain indiscernible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of misinterpretation or misuse of our predictive models is very real. Users could misunderstand predictions, leading to inappropriate decision-making. Our predictive model may contain and inadvertently perpetuate biases that we are unaware of, such as inappropriate associations with certain neighborhoods and taxis. Furthermore, users might misunderstand the predictive and uncertain nature of the model and treat its estimates as certainties. For instance, if taxi companies or transportation authorities were to make decisions solely based on the model's predictions without considering broader traffic management strategies, it could inadvertently lead to concentrated traffic, worsening congestion in certain areas. If our model were deployed in conjunction with algorithms influencing taxi availability, the system might inadvertently create self-fulfilling feedback loops, disproportionately affecting certain areas or demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, clear communication about the model's limitations, potential biases, and intended use is crucial. Providing educational resources, user-friendly interfaces, adequate documentation, and implementing fairness-aware algorithms can contribute to responsible and ethical deployment. Regular assessments, periodic audits, and interventions are necessary to avoid reinforcing existing biases. We have also considered ethical responsibilities such as the responsible disclosure of findings, ensuring the public benefits from the research, and avoiding any unintentional harm. Active engagement with potential stakeholders and the community can further help address concerns and foster ethical practices."
