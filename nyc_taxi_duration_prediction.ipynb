    "<h1>1. Introduction/Data Background</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to tackle the challenge of predicting taxi ride durations in New York City based on fundamental situational information. This research question holds significant relevance for urban commuters and transportation systems, delving into the myriad factors influencing taxi ride times, including traffic patterns, congestion, time of day, and external variables such as events or weather conditions. Our primary objective is to develop models capable of accurately forecasting the duration of taxi rides. The diverse data available further enhances the feasibility of answering the question, laying a solid foundation for training models to discern patterns and make precise predictions. The strengths of machine learning methods align well with the intricacies of this problem and allow us to uncover more nuanced relationships within the data. Beyond individual convenience, the ability to predict taxi ride times carries practical implications for optimizing taxi fleet management, resource allocation, and enhancing overall traffic flow in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since our data comes from a Kaggle competition, over one thousand other groups have investigated this research. Successful teams performed feature engineering to create fields such as month, day, hour, day of the week, haversine/manhattan distances. The used techniques including Random Forest Regression, Extra Trees Regression, PCA, XGBoost, linear regression, and Light GBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition tasks developers to predict New York City taxi cab travel times from 2016 based primarily off of pick up and drop off locations. However, the dataset also includes fields for the tax driver, the number of passengers, and weather the trip time was recording in real time. The second dataset contains weather information for the same time period and is sourced directly from the Open Meteo website. The available fields include timestamps, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and wind information. The NYC taxi cab dataset is well documented and densely populated with over one million data points. It was published by NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The weather dataset is much more sparse, specially in the wind and cloud fields, and has a much larger time range than needed to match the NYC Taxi data. These datasets provide a good source for addressing our research questions because they extensively cover NYC taxi travel for a significant time period. By combining this taxi data with meteorological information, we can delve into various factors influencing trip duration in an urban landscape and employ machine learning techniques such as XGBoost. In short, the data allows us to effectively identify significant features impacting taxi trip duration and develop a robust predictive model for accurate estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our primary investigation is focused on determining taxi cab trip duration, we are also interested in several other questions. What dates, days of the week, and times of day are most busy? Where are the most popular destinations? What factors influence taxi trip time the most? The fusion of NYC taxi data and meteorological information to understand factors influencing trip duration in a bustling metropolis offers a compelling inquiry into urban transportation dynamics. Furthermore, the multifaceted exploration of temporal, spatial, and environmental influences on travel durations in NYC, complemented by the weather dataset, presents a well-rounded analysis to reveal comprehensive insights into travel behaviors. Our data is well suited for our primary, precise research in exploring and predicting taxi trip duration, and has a single, clear answer. The dataset allows us to employ machine learning techniques like XGBoost to effectively identify and classify the significant features that impact taxi trip duration. This process helps us go one step further and develop a robust predictive model to estimate and understand trip durations accurately."

    "In our pursuit to enhance the predictive power of our model, we identified the necessity for additional features in our dataset. This realization led to the development of three distinct feature groups: datetime, distance, and weather. \n",

    "<h2>2.0 Data Cleaning</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxi cab duraction dataset from Kaggle was already cleaned and prepared for the competition. However, after doing some basic data visualization, we realized that there were some outlier data that we needed to remove. For example, there were some trips taken that, according to <code>trip_duration</code> lasted 1 second, and some that lasted about 980 days. To combat this, we removed any data points where <code>trip_duration</code> was less than 60 seconds, and where <code>trip_duration</code> in the $.005$ quantile.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to outliers in <code>trip_duration</code>, we realized there were outliers in some of the pick up and drop off locations, meaning they were far outside New York City. We fixed this problem by removed any point outside of city limits."

    "<h2>2.1 Datetime</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "A substantial portion of our dataset revolves around passenger pickup time, originally represented as a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. Recognizing the challenges posed by this format, we undertook the task of creating several features based on pickup time. These include `pickup_month`, `pickup_day` (one-hot encoded for each day of the week), `pickup_hour`, and `pickup_minute`, effortlessly implemented with Pandas datetime functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the aforementioned features, we introduced four others: `pickup_period` (one-hot encoded), `pickup_hour_sin`, `pickup_hour_cos`, and `pickup_datetime_norm`. We will now go into detail about how and why we created these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>2.0.0 Pickup Period</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "A pivotal feature, `pickup_period`, was designed to capture the time of day when passengers were picked up. This one-hot encoded feature categorized the day into four periods: morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The chosen time divisions were: morning (6:00 AM to 12:00 PM), afternoon (12:00 PM to 6:00 PM), evening (6:00 PM to 12:00 AM), and night (12:00 AM to 6:00 AM). These divisions aligned intuitively with significant periods of the day for taxi services, such as morning rush hours and evening nightlife.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation involved binning pickup hours and subsequent one-hot encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['pickup_period'] = pd.cut(df['pickup_hour'], bins=[-1, 6, 12, 18, 24], \n",
    "                                                labels=['night', 'morning', 'afternoon', 'evening'])\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['pickup_period'], drop_first=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>2.0.1 Pickup Period Sine/Cosine</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Acknowledging the cyclical nature of time, we applied circular encoding to the hour of the day. This technique involved creating `pickup_hour_sin` and `pickup_hour_cos` features using sine and cosine transformations, enhancing the model's ability to capture periodic patterns. We chose this because circular encoding is quite useful for capturing the cyclical nature of time, avoiding discontinuities (such as the start and end of a day), encoding periodic patterns, and preserving temporal relationships between different time points. Each of these reasons fit will with the desired outcome of our project, so we added this feature to our dataset, using the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\begin{split}\n",
    "        \\text{hour\\_sin} = \\sin \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi \\cdot \\text{pickup\\_hour}}{24} \\right) \\quad\n",
    "        \\text{hour\\_cos} = \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi \\cdot \\text{pickup\\_hour}}{24} \\right).\n",
    "    \\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>2.0.2 Pickup Datetime Norm</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The final feature we created in the datetime feature grouping was `pickup_datetime_norm`. This feature is simply the normalized pickup datetime. To normalize the pickup datetime, we simply converted the pickup datetime to an integer, then divided by $10^9$ to convert from nanoseconds to second. Following this, we used a simple min-max scaling. This placed all the values between 0 and 1. This feature was created using the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['pickup_datetime_norm'] = pd.to_datetime(df['pickup_datetime']).view('int64') // 10**9\n",
    "df['pickup_datetime_norm'] = (df['pickup_datetime_norm'] - df['pickup_datetime_norm'].min()) / \n",
    "                                (df['pickup_datetime_norm'].max() - df['pickup_datetime_norm'].min()).\n",

    "<h2>2.1 Distance</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the distance feature grouping, we created two features involing the estimated distance between the pickup and dropoff locations. The first feature estimates the distance between the points using the Manhattan distance, while second feature estimates the distance using Dijkstra's algorithm to more closely follow new York roads. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>2.1.0 Manhattan Distance</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manhattan distance, also known as the $L_1$ distance or taxicab distance, is a metric used to calculate the distance between two points in a grid-based system. We chose to use the Manhattan distance for two main reasons. The first reason is because of its usefulness in grid-based navigation. While New York City is not a perfect grid, many of its streets are laid out in a grid-like fashion, thus the Manhattan distance will be a much better approximation for distance than the Euclidean distance. The second reason is because of its simplicity and interpretability. The Manhattan distance is simply the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the two points. This makes it very easy to calculate and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our dataset, we have the pickup and dropoff latitude and longitude coordinates. We can use these coordinates to calculate the Manhattan distance between the pickup and dropoff locations (in kilometers). We calculated the Manhattan distance by first converting the pickup and dropoff coordinate points into radians and using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\text{Manhattan Distance} = R \\cdot \\left( \\left| \\text{pickup\\_latitude} - \\text{dropoff\\_latitude} \\right| + \\left| \\text{pickup\\_longitude} - \\text{dropoff\\_longitude} \\right| \\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the radius of the Earth in kilometers (6371 km). This gives us the approximated distance between the pickup and dropoff locations in kilometers. While not perfect, we found this to be a decent alternative to using an expensive and time consuming API to get the actual distance between the two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>2.1.1 Computing Distance with Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "With over 1.4 million data points over a relatively small geography, the pick up and drop off locations provide an effective proxy for the actual road map of New York. We can use this information to estimate the distance between the two points using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. We chose to use Dijkstra's algorithm because it is a well known and well documented algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. We modified the algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph, where the edges of the graph are the roads in New York City with weights equal to their geographic length, and the nodes are the pick up and drop off locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the size of the graph by removing nodes that are too close together, removing the few hundred nodes that lie well outside the metropolitan area, and cropping the graph for each distance calculation to only include nodes that lie roughly between the pick up and drop off locations. This reduces the size of the graph from over 1.4 million nodes to a few thousand nodes. We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the pick up and drop off locations. The resulting cost of the shortest path is an estimate of the actual driving distance required to travel between the two points, which is one of the strongest predictors of taxi ride duration."

    "<h2>2.2 Weather</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering potential features to add to our dataset, accounting for the effect of local weather on taxi ride tme was one of the most obvious additions to include. For example, if it is raining or snowing, there will be more traffic on the roads, and more people who would normally walk would prefer a taxi. A dataset created by Kaggle user [@Aadam](https://www.kaggle.com/aadimator) contains a miriad of weather data for New York City between 2016 and 2022 on an hourly basis. This dataset includes features such as temperature (in Celcius), precipition (in mm), cloud cover (low, mid, high, and total), wind speed (in km/h), and wind direction. We decided to use temperature, precipitation, and total cloud cover as features in our dataset with a simple join on the pickup datetime, rounded to the nearest whole hour."

This duration feature acts as an initial estimate for the model's actual trip_duration prediction. To do this, we fit a pickup and dropoff KMeans clustering model with 200 clusters. Images of these are shown in section `4. Data Visualization`. We then labeled each pickup location and drop off location in the data with its respective cluster label. By grouping the data by these cluster pairs, we computed the average trip_duration between each cluster pair. This yielded a dataframe with columns `['pickup_cluster', 'dropoff_cluser', 'avg_cluster_duration']`. We are then able to join this onto the original dataframe and then drop the `pickup_cluster` and `dropoff_cluster` columns since those are categorical features. Finally, \n",
