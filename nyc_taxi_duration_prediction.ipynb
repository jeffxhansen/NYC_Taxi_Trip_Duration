    "<h1>1. Introduction</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to tackle the challenge of predicting taxi ride durations in New York City based on fundamental situational information. This research question holds significant relevance for urban commuters and transportation systems, delving into the myriad factors influencing taxi ride times, including traffic patterns, congestion, time of day, and external variables such as events or weather conditions. Our primary objective is to develop models capable of accurately forecasting the duration of taxi rides. The diverse data available further enhances the feasibility of answering the question, laying a solid foundation for training models to discern patterns and make precise predictions. The strengths of machine learning methods align well with the intricacies of this problem and allow us to uncover more nuanced relationships within the data. Beyond individual convenience, the ability to predict taxi ride times carries practical implications for optimizing taxi fleet management, resource allocation, and enhancing overall traffic flow in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since our data comes from a Kaggle competition, over one thousand other groups have investigated this research. Successful teams performed feature engineering to create fields such as month, day, hour, day of the week, haversine/manhattan distances. The used techniques including Random Forest Regression, Extra Trees Regression, PCA, XGBoost, linear regression, and Light GBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The competition tasks developers to predict New York City taxi cab travel times from 2016 based primarily off of pick up and drop off locations. However, the dataset also includes fields for the tax driver, the number of passengers, and weather the trip time was recording in real time. The second dataset contains weather information for the same time period and is sourced directly from the Open Meteo website. The available fields include timestamps, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and wind information. The NYC taxi cab dataset is well documented and densely populated with over one million data points. It was published by NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The weather dataset is much more sparse, specially in the wind and cloud fields, and has a much larger time range than needed to match the NYC Taxi data. These datasets provide a good source for addressing our research questions because they extensively cover NYC taxi travel for a significant time period. By combining this taxi data with meteorological information, we can delve into various factors influencing trip duration in an urban landscape and employ machine learning techniques such as XGBoost. In short, the data allows us to effectively identify significant features impacting taxi trip duration and develop a robust predictive model for accurate estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While our primary investigation is focused on determining taxi cab trip duration, we are also interested in several other questions. What dates, days of the week, and times of day are most busy? Where are the most popular destinations? What factors influence taxi trip time the most? The fusion of NYC taxi data and meteorological information to understand factors influencing trip duration in a bustling metropolis offers a compelling inquiry into urban transportation dynamics. Furthermore, the multifaceted exploration of temporal, spatial, and environmental influences on travel durations in NYC, complemented by the weather dataset, presents a well-rounded analysis to reveal comprehensive insights into travel behaviors. Our data is well suited for our primary, precise research in exploring and predicting taxi trip duration, and has a single, clear answer. The dataset allows us to employ machine learning techniques like XGBoost to effectively identify and classify the significant features that impact taxi trip duration. This process helps us go one step further and develop a robust predictive model to estimate and understand trip durations accurately."

Many of the streets of New York are laid out in a grid-like fashion, so this metric can better approximate road distances than the Euclidean distance. The Manhattan distance is also more simple and interpretable, since it computes the sum of the absolute values of the differences between the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the two points. We calculated the Manhattan distance by first converting the pickup and dropoff coordinate points into radians and using the following formula:\n",

    "With over 1.4 million data points over a relatively small geography, the pick up and drop off locations provide an effective proxy for the actual road map of New York. We can use this information to estimate the distance between the two points using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. We chose to use Dijkstra's algorithm because it is a well known and well documented algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph. We modified the algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a graph, where the edges of the graph are the roads in New York City with weights equal to their geographic length, and the nodes are the pick up and drop off locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the size of the graph by removing nodes that are too close together, removing the few hundred nodes that lie well outside the metropolitan area, and cropping the graph for each distance calculation to only include nodes that lie roughly between the pick up and drop off locations. This reduces the size of the graph from over 1.4 million nodes to a few thousand nodes. We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the pick up and drop off locations. The resulting cost of the shortest path is an estimate of the actual driving distance required to travel between the two points, which is one of the strongest predictors of taxi ride duration. -->"

To do this, we fit a pickup and dropoff KMeans clustering model with 200 clusters. Images of these are shown in section `4. Data Visualization`. We then labeled each pickup location and drop off location in the data with its respective cluster label. By grouping the data by these cluster pairs, we computed the average trip_duration between each cluster pair and merged this onto the original dataframe.

    "<h2>4.1 Ethical Implications</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research involves analyzing a large dataset created by tracking some of the life-style patterns of real people living in New York during 2016, raising concerns about privacy and responsible data usage. The taxi dataset contains information about drivers, passengers, and their travel patterns which necessitates careful handling to prevent unintended consequences. \n",
    "Individual behaviors, locations, and travel patterns are sensitive information. This dataset and our model protect this private information by excluding all personally identifiable information to completely anonymize the data. This step ensures that only aggregate information can be meaningful, and the patterns of individuals remain indiscernable. this privacy is crucial, requiring anonymization and secure data storage practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a risk of misinterpretation or misuse of our predictive models. Users could misunderstand predictions, leading to inappropriate decision-making. Our predictive model may contain and inadvertently perpetuate biases that we are unaware of, such as inappropriate associations certain neighborhoods and taxis. Furthermore, users might misunderstand the predictive nature of the model and treat its estimates as certainties. For instance, a passenger might assume the predicted duration is a guaranteed travel time, leading to potential frustration or dissatisfaction if actual conditions deviate. If taxi companies or transportation authorities were to make decisions solely based on the model's predictions without considering broader traffic management strategies, it could inadvertently lead to concentrated traffic, worsening congestion in certain areas. If the model is integrated into pricing algorithms, there is a risk of surge pricing being triggered based on predicted high demand, potentially disadvantaging users in specific locations during peak times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, clear communication about the model's limitations, potential biases, and intended use is crucial. Providing educational resources for users and implementing fairness-aware algorithms can contribute to responsible and ethical deployment. Implementating user-friendly interfaces, transparent model documentation, and accessible educational resources can also mitigate the risk of misuse. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If our model were deployed in conjunction with algorithms influencing taxi availability, the system might inadvertently create self-fulfilling feedback loops, disproportionately affecting certain areas or demographics. Regular assessments, periodic audits, and interventions are necessary to avoid reinforcing existing biases. By regularly updating models based on real-world outcomes, developers can help refine and improve fairness why mitigating the risk of a destructive feedback loops. We have also considered ethical resposibilities such as the responsible disclosure of findings, ensuring the public benefits from the research, and avoiding any unintentional harm. Active engagement with potential stakeholders and the community can help address concerns and foster ethical practices."
